# @titan/cli

This folder contains the Titan CLI package.

## What it’s for

- Developer tooling / automation around the monorepo
- Running scripted workflows from the command line

## Where to look first

- `apps/cli/package.json` (scripts + entry points)
- `apps/cli/src/` (implementation)

If you are trying to understand runtime app behavior (Electron + Next.js + IPC), the CLI is not the first stop:

- Read `docs/TITAN_AI_FULL_PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md`
- Use `docs/REPO_MAP.md` to jump to the right code quickly
